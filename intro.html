			<!-- Getting Started -->
			<div id="div1" class="content" style="display: none;">
				<h2>Getting Started</h2>
				<p class="center">When starting to play Naraka's Showdown Mode, I recommended that you choose one hero to main and two secondary choices. 
					This is because when you pass Normal and Hard difficulty missions, Showdown does not allow duplicate heroes on the same team. 
					Picking two secondary choices helps to ensure that you are not left in a tight spot because someone else locked in your favorite hero(es) first. 
					Kurumi is recommended to be one of your main 3 because of her being the only hero that can heal & buff her teammates.</p>
				
				<hr><h3>Advancing through the Story</h3>
				<p class="center">There are a total of 5 chapters currently in the game. 
					4 of those chapters are in Morus Isle and 1 is in Holoroth.
					In total, there are 13 missions among the regular story, with each mission having 3 difficulties.
					Each mission has 2 heroes that it wants you to beat it on a certain difficulty with to unlock their corresponding lore segment.</p>
				
				<hr><h3>Difficulty Levels</h3>
				<p class="center">As of right now there are 3 difficulty levels: <strong>Normal, Hard and Nightscream</strong>.
					<br><strong>Normal</strong> difficulty can be considered the tutorial of the game.
					Many of the missions will have limited mechanics, enemies will have smaller movesets and attack less often, and bosses are limited to 1 phase.
					<br><strong>Hard</strong> difficulty introduces Omens, semi-random events that can make certain enemies stronger or add hazards to the battlefield.
					Furthermore, it introduces more boss phases and more aggressive enemies.
					<br><strong>Nightscream</strong> difficulty brings in mutliple Omens per mission and significantly more aggressive enemies.
					This will be your first major difficulty spike that you'll face as everything hits harder and takes longer to kill.
					However, at this point the missions here will have better loot pools to complete your Souljade builds with.</p>

				<hr><h3>Fatigue System</h3>
				<strong><p id="reset" class="with-caption">Next Reset: </p></strong>
				<p class="center">At the time of the date above, the fatigue system is reset back to 0 as well as the weekly quests you have. 
					<br>At <strong>0 to 600 fatigue</strong> you will recieve 150% rewards (50% more rewards).
					<br>At <strong>601 to 1800 fatigue</strong> you will recieve 100% rewards.
					<br>At <strong>1801 to 2400 fatigue</strong> you will recieve only 75% rewards.
					<br>Once you have reached <strong>2400 fatigue</strong>, you can no longer receive any Showdown-based rewards until the next reset.
					<br>Every mission consumes fatigue when ran, with the amount consumed depending on the type of mission and how much of it you completed.</p>
				
				<hr><h3>Mission Types</h3>
				<p class="center">As of right now, there are 15 different missions available, 
					those being <strong>Eventide Ember, Dharma-Ending Ruin, Ominous Descent, Desert Tribulations, Immovable, 
					Toppled Mountains, Gelid Yushan, Chaos of the Immortals, None Shall Pass, Together We Stand, 
					Dangers in the Deep, Miasma Swirl, Chasm Undertow, Enigma Domain,</strong> and <strong>Yama's Abyss</strong>.
					<br>Each mission can fit into a category, those being <strong>Stronghold Assault, Wave Defense, 
					Boss Fight, Enigma Domain,</strong> and the newest category <strong>Yama's Abyss</strong>.</p>

					<h4 id="stronghold-assault">Stronghold Assault</h4>
					<p class="left">- Missions: <strong>Eventide Ember, Desert Tribulations, Chaos of the Immortals,</strong> and <strong>Dangers in the Deep</strong>.
						<br>- Objective: Kill Stronghold's chest guards and the final boss. 
						<br>- Description: Serve as great Sense level boosters because they're generally a much lower difficulty, 
						don't require you to kill everything, and are guaranteed to drop 6 or more souljades.</p>
					<h4>Wave Defense</h4>
					<p class="left">- Missions: <strong>Dharma-Ending Ruin, Immovable, None Shall Pass,</strong> and <strong>Miasma Swirl</strong>. 
						<br>- Objective: Kill all mobs and boss(es). 
						<br>- Description: Generally the longest mission of each chapter, but have more sought-after drops in their loot pool. 
						Heavier focuses on teamwork and a smaller pool of guaranteed Souljades, however, due to the number of enemies, can have the largest amount of drops.</p>
					<h4>Boss Fight</h4>
					<p class="left">- Missions: <strong>Omnious Descent, Toppled Mountain, Gelid Yushan, Together We Stand,</strong> and <strong>Chasm Undertow</strong>.
						<br>- Objective: Defeat the boss.
						<br>- Description: Can be the longest or shortest mission depending on how strong your team composition is. 
						Usually contains the most sought-after Souljades, but has a lower drop rate due to the small number of sources and a limited amount of Omens. Consumables are the most limited here, so effective use of heals is warranted.</p>
					<h4>Enigma Domain</h4>
					<p class="left">- Missions: <strong>Topaz</strong> and <strong>Peak</strong>.
						<br>- Objective: Reach Enhance Level 8 or 9 and defeat all bosses.
						<br>- Description: Having a max clear time of ~16 minutes, a pre-established strategy is encouraged, 
						with Archers being ignored and Hammer Ents & Warlocks being prioritized.</p>
					<h4>Yama's Abyss</h4>
					<p class="left">- Missions: <strong>Stages 1 - 48</strong> and <strong>Void-Space Stages 25, 30</strong> & <strong>35</strong>
						<br>- Objective: Clear all 15 rooms (30 rooms in Void-Space).
						<br>- Description: The new longest mission type we have as of now. 
						Gets progressively difficult as you make it down the stages, with only the best of the best being able to achieve the rank of Showdown Paragon and clearing up to stage 48.</p>
